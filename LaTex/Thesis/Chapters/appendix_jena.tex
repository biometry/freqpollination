 \caption{Per-flower visitation rates of the five focal species over different frequencies. Each point represents one observation of 15 minutes. The y-axis is plotted on a log scale due to the divergence in attractiveness of the focal species. The linear mixed effect model with Subplot nested in Plot as random factor show a sigmoidal frequency dependence for all species but \textit{Lathyrus pratensis}. Floral cover and species richness were dropped as explanatory variables in the model selection process. R$^{2}$ was calculated with the "r.squaredGLMM"-function of the MuMIn-Package \citep{MuMIn}}
