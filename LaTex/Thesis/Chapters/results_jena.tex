\subsubsection*{Visitation Rates}			

In total, I made 385 observations, each representing pollinator activity records for 15min in a 80cm x 80cm plot. In total, I analyzed data from 96,25h of observation on 246.4m$^{2}$.

\textit{Onobrychis viciifolia} was the most attractive plant with a maximum of 318 visits in one observation. The per-flower visitation rate varied strongly with the attractiveness of the focal species. Per observation, I recorded 1.4 $\pm$ 1.8 (mean $\pm$ SD) visits per flower with a maximum of 10.7 visits per flower (again \textit{Onobrychis viciifolia}) and 31 observation with no visit at all to the focal species. The per-flower visitation rate was significantly different between the two very attractive species \textit{Geranium pratense} and \textit{Onobrychis viciifolia} and the three less attractive species  \textit{Trifolium pratense}, \textit{Lotus corniculatus} and \textit{Lathyrus pratensis} (\textit{P} $\leq$ 0.001, tab.~\ref{tab:VR_spec}). The subplots contained 3 $\pm$ 1.2 (mean $\pm$ SD) flowering species including the focal species, the species richness was higher at the plot level with 8 $\pm$ 2.4 (mean $\pm$ SD) flowering species.

Within the two groups, there is no significant difference between the species. }

\subsubsection*{Frequency Dependence}			
Floral cover and species richness had both individually and in the interaction term with frequency no effect on the visitation rate and were removed from the model (Cover: F$_{df\shorteq1}$ = 1.17, \textit{P} = 0.28; Species Richness: F$ _{df\shorteq1} $ = 1.15, \textit{P} = 0.29). 
%Freq:Cover 0.446 //Freq:SR 0.426

The linear mixed effect model showed an effect of species and frequency individually and with interactions on the per-flower visitation rate (Species: F$_{df\shorteq4}$ = 141.13, \textit{P} $\leq$ 0.0001; Frequency: F$_{df\shorteq1}$ = 18.29, \textit{P} $\leq$ 0.0001; Species x Frequency F$_{ df\shorteq4}$ = 5.2, \textit{P} $\leq$ 0.001, tab.~\ref{tab:anova}). Interestingly, frequency contributed also as quadratic and cubic term with its interactions to species explanatory power to the model, giving the relationship a non-linear character (Tab.~\ref{tab:anova}). Figure~\ref{fig:LME} showed the cubic relationship of four focal species and the summed data and a quadratic relationship for \textit{Lathyrus pratensis}. The cubic curve is defined by a strong increase for frequencies below 20\% followed by a minimum between 50 and 80\% depending on the species before raising again with increasing dominance of the focal species. However, the visitation rate of \textit{Lathyrus pratensis} showed a maximum at 60\% frequency and decreases afterwards.

The y-axis is plotted on a log scale due to the variance in attractiveness of the focal species. The linear mixed effect model with patch nested in plot as random factor show a cubic frequency dependence for all species but \textit{Lathyrus pratensis}. Floral cover and species richness were dropped as explanatory variables in the model selection process. R$^{2}$ was calculated with the "r.squaredGLMM"-function of the MuMIn-Package \citep{MuMIn}}
