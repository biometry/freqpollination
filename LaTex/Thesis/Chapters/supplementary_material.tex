	\includegraphics[width=14cm]{Images/nonfreq}
	\caption{Frequency independent influence of floral cover and degree of flower agglomeration on the summed visits within one simulation run. Cover strongly influences the number of visits as it reduces the flight and search time. Plot A shows a saturated relationship for all cluster values. This matches the Holling´s type II functional response. B) The degree of clustering also determines the sum of visits in a hump-shaped function. The maximum (depending on the cover) lays between 5 and 10 flowers per cluster. A small agglomeration of flowers reduces search times but keeps the next patch within short distance. The bigger the cluster, the more difficult to find the next one.}

	\caption{The influence of reward regrowth, vision, search limit and number of bee-agents on the total visits within a 1000 tick simulation run. A) Only an unnatural high reward regrowth has a small negative influence on the visits. B) Bee-agents with a far field of view can detect flowers faster, move in a direct way towards them and be therefore more efficient. However, the curve is saturated at a view of 20 patches. C) An increase in search time limit decreases the sum of visits and spread the variance. Bees-agents will keep searching for rare flowers instead of switching to the common species. D) As assumed, more bees lead to more visits.}

Only the unnatural high reward function (complete regrowth after 10 seconds) has an influence on the frequency dependence: the bee-agents have no more reason to change preference due to bad reward gained. This favors the more common species as shown in the opposite curving for no-cluster environments. A lower regrowth rate has no effect.}

If sees far, it can move on direct way towards the next preferred flower and saves searching time. But it also more often fly longer distances instead of changing to the common species. A high vision therefore increases the frequency dependence and a very low vision shifts the advantage towards the more abundant species.}

The search limit is the number of seconds within a bee-agent searches for a unvisited and preferred flower, moving around the meadow by a correlated random walk. After the search limit is reached, the probability to change its flower preference increases with every additional second of unsuccessful search. The search limit has a similar effect on the outcome of the model as the vision because it also influences the change probability. With a higher search time, the bee-agent continues searing instead of switching to the more abundant flower, the frequency dependence is increased. A higher cluster value weakens the effect.}
