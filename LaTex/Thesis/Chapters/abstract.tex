%1. Set the scene
%
%Tropical forests are some of the most species-rich ecosystems of the world.
%
%2. Raise the problem
%
%The reason for this, however, is still widely debated. Hypotheses range from processes related to productivity over environmental stability to the historical changes in geography. ("However")
%
%3. Introduce your approach.
%
%Here, we tried to contrast these different hypotheses by using data from … together with .. (fancy new method) "In this paper"
%
%4. State your results
%
%We find that hypothesis X seems to be significantly better supported by our data than all alternatives we test. Specifically …
%
%5. Give your conclusions and discuss the wider significance
%
%In conclusion, our study supports the hypothesis that species diversity in the tropics is mainly drive by higher productivity. These results challenge some long- held ideas about geographical stability being the main reason for global diversity patterns. They also have important practical applications for mitigation of climate change, as …
